🛒 Product Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a customer purchasing a product based on their online behavior and demographics. Using a binary classification approach, the model aims to assist e-commerce platforms in understanding customer intent and improving targeted marketing strategies.

🎯 Problem Statement
Goal: Predict whether a customer will buy a product (Yes/No) based on the following features:

Time spent on website

Age

Gender

Number of ads clicked

Number of previous purchases

This is a binary classification problem, where the output is either:

1 – Will Purchase

0 – Will Not Purchase

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression – A linear model used for binary classification.

Decision Tree Classifier – A non-linear model that captures complex decision boundaries.

📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Google Sheets and contains real-world style records of user behavior on an e-commerce platform. Each record includes:

Time_Spent

Age

Gender

Ads_Clicked

Previous_Purchases

Purchase (Target Variable)

🔍 Real-Life Application
This project simulates a practical e-commerce behavior modeling scenario. It can help businesses:

Predict conversion probability

Optimize ad targeting

Personalize shopping experiences

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python

pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn (for data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook

✅ Outcomes
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships

Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models

Achieved insights into key buying indicators
